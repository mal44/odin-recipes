<h4>Mushroom and Spinach Pasta</h4>

<p>This homemade ravioli is actually vegetarian, although no one who tries it can tell! The savory filling contains three different cheeses, mushrooms, and spinach. Although it's a rather time-consuming recipe to prepare, the results are well worth it!</p>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons water, or more if needed</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package fresh  mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>4 ounces cream cheese softened</li>
    <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 egg white, beaten</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together 1 teaspoon olive oil, water, and whole eggs in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. Combine flour and salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well and stir just until combined. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 5 to 10 minutes, adding more flour or water as needed. Wrap dough tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside to rest. </li>

    <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, and continue cooking and stirring until the vegetables are soft and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool.</li>

    <li>Beat cream cheese in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the cooled mushroom mixture, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, spinach, 1 tablespoon chives, parsley, and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and pepper.</li>

    <li>Roll the pasta dough out to about 1/16 inch thick. Cut 3 to 4-inch circles using a large cookie cutter. Roll each circle out as thin as possible. Working with one circle at a time, brush the pasta lightly with the egg white. Scoop about 1 heaping tablespoon full of the mushroom filling onto the center of the pasta, then cover with a second piece of pasta, pinching the edges to seal. Cut the sealed ravioli with the cookie cutter once more to create a uniform shape. Place the finished ravioli on a floured baking sheet, and repeat the process with the remaining pasta and filling.</li>

    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook until the pasta floats to the top, 3 to 4 minutes; drain.</li>

    <li>To make sauce: Melt butter in a skillet over high heat, cooking and stirring until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons chives. Serve over hot ravioli.</li>
