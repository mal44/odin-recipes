    <h4>Diner-Style Smash Burger</h4>
    <p>A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off the grill in minutes so it’s a great way to feed a crowd.</p>
    <p>Smash burgers have the iconic flavor profile of classic Burgers, but that double burger patty with cheese melted in between is irresistible and you’ll love the special sauce.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 brioche buns</li>
        <li>1 head of iceberg lettuce, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>6 oz sliced dill pickles</li>
        <li>1 large-sized tomato</li>
        <li>1 thinly sliced red onion</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Patties – Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Make Sauce – Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prep Toppings – fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
        <li>Toast buns – lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</li>
        <li>Cook patties – increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.</li>
        <li>Add cheese – place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</li>
    </ol>
